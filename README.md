# game-chess
In this project I am building a chess game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The game can be played by 2 people, taking turns.

The following chess rules have not yet been implemented in the project:

Check, checkmate, draw by stalemate, draw by repetition, draw by insufficient material, castling, promotion, en passant.

Planned features:

Timer (losing on time), chess engine (playing against computer).
